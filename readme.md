# Void Shooter

Void shooter is a little arcade shooter game I'm making for fun.<br>
There is no place to test it for now, but you can still clone the repo and build it !

## How to build

1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure to have at least Node.js v16 installed on your system.
3. Run `npm run start`.
